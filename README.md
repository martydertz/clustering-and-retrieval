# clustering-and-retrieval

I'm providing files for students taking Coursera's [Machine Learning: Clustering & Retrieval] (https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-clustering-and-retrieval)
course. 

For each of the three topic models used in the Week Five assessment, a corresponding csv file with the top 1500 words for each of the 10. Files 
were generated using the graphlab topic model's [get_topics method](https://turi.com/products/create/docs/generated/graphlab.topic_model.TopicModel.get_topics.html).
